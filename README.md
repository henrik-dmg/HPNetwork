![Swift](https://github.com/henrik-dmg/HPNetwork/workflows/Swift/badge.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/henrik-dmg/HPNetwork/graph/badge.svg?token=WZU3LZK4VD)](https://codecov.io/gh/henrik-dmg/HPNetwork)

`HPNetwork` is a protocol-based networking stack written in pure Swift

## Installation

Starting with v4 HPNetwork is only available via Swift Package Manager.

- Package.swift: `.package(url: "https://github.com/henrik-dmg/HPNetwork", from: "4.0.0")`
- Xcode: `https://github.com/henrik-dmg/HPNetwork`

## Documentation

Documentation has been moved to https://henrik-dmg.github.io/HPNetwork/. That way I don't have to copy it back and forth between the README and the `.docc` catalogs.
